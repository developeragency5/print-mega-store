                <p>
                  When you place an order through Print Mega Store, you are making an offer to purchase products from us. All orders are subject to acceptance by Print Mega Store. We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any reason, including but not limited to product availability, errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our fraud detection systems.

                <p className="mt-4">
                  Upon placing an order, you will receive an order confirmation email acknowledging receipt of your order. This confirmation does not constitute acceptance of your order. Your order is accepted and a contract is formed only when we ship the products and send you a shipping confirmation email.
